This dashboard was created by instructions from [this lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czON7fhEuYI&t=1599s) in YouTube Channel [PK: An Excel Expert](https://www.youtube.com/c/PKAnExcelExpert/about)

In this Dashboard we have three pages/screens:

- Category and Product, giving more detailed information on commodity
- Employees, demonstrating staff performance
